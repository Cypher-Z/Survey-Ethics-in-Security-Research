## Survey: Current Status of ethical considerations in cyphersecurity research

Hello! 

This research project is to figure out the current status of ethical issues response for security research, which is conducted by the Network and Information Security Lab at Tsinghua University.

Ethical issues have received much attention in security academic community. Ideally, researchers can mitigate ethical risks under guidance from authoritative agencies, such as Institutional Review Board (IRB). However, in practice,  many academic institutions do not have agencies like IRB, which limits the help available to security researchers from these institutions.

This questionnaire is a survey of the current status of ethical risk responses for security researchers. Furthermore, we hope results from this questionnaire can help security researchers receive more resources for ethical guidance.

This questionnaire will take you approximately 1-2 minutes to complete. The results will be used for academic purposes only and will not involve your sensitive information. 
(We use the questionnaire system, “Wen Juanxing”, which has not been found to violate user privacy.)

Thanks very much for your participation!
